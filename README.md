[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

  - Add, remove, or edit flashcards from inside the TUI
  - Changes persist automatically to disk

- **Atomic file writes**
  - Safe saving through temporary files to prevent corruption

## Folder Structure

```
flashcards-rs/
├── Cargo.toml
├── src/

    │   └── answers.txt
    └── Earth/
        ├── questions.txt
        └── answers.txt
```

Each topic folder must contain:
- `questions.txt` — one question per line
- `answers.txt` — one answer per line, in the same order as the questions

### 2. Add Topics
The app automatically scans `/topics/` for folders.
To create new topics manually:
```bash
mkdir -p topics/Space
echo "What is a black hole?" > topics/Space/questions.txt
echo "A region of spacetime with gravity so strong nothing can escape it." > topics/Space/answers.txt
```

Or create them directly inside the app with `C`.

## Saved Sessions

When you finish a quiz, your results are saved automatically:
```
flashcard_responses_20251019-225918.txt
```
Each session log includes:
- Question number and text
- Your answer
- The correct answer

## Development Notes

### Screen State Machine

The app operates as a **finite state machine** with distinct UI screens managed by the `Screen` enum.
Each state defines a unique interaction context. Transitions are event-driven (keyboard input).

| State | Description | Key Transitions |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| `TopicSelect` | Browse or create topics. | `Enter` → `MainMenu`, `C` → `TopicCreate` |
| `TopicCreate` | Input new topic name. | `Enter` → `MainMenu`, `Esc` → `TopicSelect` |
| `MainMenu` | Choose between study or edit modes. | `S` → `Mode`, `E` → `CardList` |
| `CardList` | Edit existing cards. | `E` → `EditQuestion`, `A` → `EditAnswer`, `N` → add new |
| `Mode` | Select random or sequential order. | `Y`/`N` → `Ask` |
| `Ask` | Display current question and take input. | `Enter` → `Reveal`, `Ctrl+R` → `Review` |
| `Reveal` | Show correct answer and next-step options. | `N` → next, `Ctrl+E/A` → edit, `Ctrl+R` → review |
| `EditQuestion` / `EditAnswer` | Edit text of a card. | `Enter` → save and return |
| `Review` | Scrollable list of all responses. | `Esc` / `Ctrl+B` → return |
| `Done` | Quiz finished summary screen. | `R` → review |
| `ConfirmQuit` | Exit confirmation modal. | `Y` → exit, `N` → return |

This modular architecture simplifies adding new screens or features (e.g., timed quizzes or import/export support).
